        <h2>Welcome to Data Exploration</h2>

        <p>
          Welcome to this module, where your consulting work takes an exciting turn. Your
          startup client is impressed with your data preparation work—the dataset is clean,
          properly structured, and enriched with time-based features. Now they need compelling
          insights and visualizations for their investor presentation. This is where you
          transform from data preparer to data storyteller.
        </p>

        <h2>What You'll Learn</h2>

        <p>
          Data exploration is where prepared data reveals its secrets. This is the detective
          phase of data science—uncovering hidden patterns, spotting trends, and discovering
          relationships that will guide your modeling decisions and inform business strategy.
        </p>

        <p>In this module, you'll master two essential skills:</p>

        <div class="objective-list">
          <h3>Module Learning Objectives</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Statistical Analysis & Pattern Discovery:</strong> Learn to apply
              descriptive statistics and correlation analysis to understand your data deeply.
              Discover temporal patterns, identify relationships between variables, and generate
              hypotheses for predictive modeling.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Data Storytelling & Visualization:</strong> Master the art of creating
              effective visualizations that communicate insights clearly to stakeholders.
              Design publication-quality plots that reveal trends, patterns, and business
              opportunities hidden in the data.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>Why Data Exploration Matters</h2>

        <p>
          Imagine having a treasure map but never studying it before starting your journey.
          You might eventually find treasure through luck, but you'd miss valuable insights
          about the best paths, potential obstacles, and hidden opportunities. Data exploration
          is your treasure map study session—it reveals where to look, what patterns matter,
          and which variables deserve your modeling attention.
        </p>

        <p>
          For your bike-sharing client, exploration means understanding demand patterns across
          different times and conditions, identifying peak usage periods, discovering weather
          impacts, and uncovering seasonal variations. These insights don't just inform your
          models—they directly answer business questions and guide strategic decisions.
        </p>

        <p>
          Through this module, you'll learn to extract actionable intelligence from your
          prepared dataset. You'll create visualizations that tell compelling stories to
          investors, identify patterns that reveal business opportunities, and develop
          hypotheses that will guide your predictive modeling in the next module.
        </p>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <p>
            <strong>Remember:</strong> Great data scientists don't just build models—they
            understand their data intimately. Exploration is where this understanding develops,
            turning you from someone who manipulates data into someone who truly comprehends
            what the data reveals about the business.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h2>Ready to Explore?</h2>

        <p>
          Your client is waiting for insights that will impress their investors and guide
          their business strategy. The clean, prepared dataset is ready. Your exploration
          skills will reveal the patterns and stories hidden within.
