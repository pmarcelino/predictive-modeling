The distribution histogram (top-right) shows that most hours operate at modest utilization levels (mean 6.39%, median 4.83%), with a right-skewed distribution indicating occasional high-demand periods. The weekly pattern analysis (bottom-left) shows relatively consistent performance across days, peaking on Friday (6.59%). The monthly trend (bottom-right) reveals seasonal patterns with June showing peak utilization (8.07%) and winter months showing the lowest efficiency.

    "**1. Immediate Clarity Test**\n",
    "\n",
    "Can stakeholders understand your key insight within 5 seconds? Your weekday vs. weekend daily demand profile comparison (Section 3.1) passes this test because the line patterns immediately communicate the different temporal structures—bimodal weekday peaks versus single midday weekend peak—even though average hourly demands are similar. If your visualization requires extensive explanation, redesign it using the visual perception hierarchy from Section 2.1.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Accuracy and Integrity Check**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Avoid scale manipulation**: Don't truncate the y-axis on your temperature-demand scatter plot to exaggerate correlation strength. The r = 0.394 relationship tells an honest story about moderate temperature effects alongside other demand drivers.\n",
    "- **Maintain proportional spacing**: Your monthly seasonal patterns need consistent time intervals—don't compress winter months just because demand is lower.\n",
    "- **Show uncertainty appropriately**: Include confidence intervals on trend lines without overwhelming the primary insight.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Common Pitfalls to Avoid**\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the visualization types from Section 2.2, watch for these mistakes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Chart type mismatches**: Don't use pie charts for your hourly demand profile (area comparison is inaccurate). Use line plots that leverage position along a common time axis.\n",
    "- **Color overload**: Your temperature-demand scatter plot with seasonal color coding works because it adds meaningful context. Random decorative colors reduce clarity.\n",
    "- **Complexity creep**: That operational efficiency dashboard in Section 3.3 uses four coordinated panels effectively. Adding six more panels would overwhelm rather than illuminate."
