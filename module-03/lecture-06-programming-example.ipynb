    "Welcome back, junior data consultant! Your Capital Bikes Washington D.C. client was impressed with your data cleaning work and now they need answers to critical business questions. Today, you'll transform from basic data manipulation to sophisticated statistical analysis - discovering the hidden patterns that drive bike-sharing demand using proven statistical techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of statistical analysis like being a detective examining evidence. While anyone can collect data, professional consultants know how to measure patterns, calculate relationships, and quantify uncertainty. You'll learn to use numbers as proof - transforming \"we think demand is higher on weekends\" into \"weekends show 34% higher average demand with 95% confidence, suggesting we need 50-75 additional bikes at key stations.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Your client is counting on you to turn their historical bike-sharing data into evidence-based recommendations worth millions in operational improvements. Every statistical technique you master serves this consulting purpose: providing the mathematical proof that drives confident business decisions.\n",

    "The hourly pattern reveals dramatic commuter behavior with sharp peaks at 8am (362.8) and 5pm (468.8), yet the weekend/weekday difference is surprisingly small (-4.0 bikes/hour, only 2%).
