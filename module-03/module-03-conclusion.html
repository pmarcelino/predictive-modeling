        <h2>Congratulations on Completing Data Exploration!</h2>

        <div class="success-box">
          <p>
            <strong>Well done!</strong> You've successfully transformed from a data preparer
            into a data storyteller. You can now uncover hidden patterns, create compelling
            visualizations, and extract insights that drive business decisions. This is where
            data science becomes truly powerful.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h2>What You've Accomplished</h2>

        <p>
          The exploration skills you've developed in this module are what separate good data
          professionals from great ones. You've learned to see beyond numbers and recognize
          the stories data tells.
        </p>

        <div class="achievement-list">
          <h3>Your New Professional Toolkit</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Statistical Analysis Mastery:</strong> You can now apply descriptive
              statistics and correlation analysis to understand data deeply. You've learned
              to identify patterns, spot trends, and discover relationships that inform
              business strategy and modeling decisions.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Visualization Excellence:</strong> You've mastered the art of creating
              publication-quality plots that communicate insights clearly. Your visualizations
              don't just display data—they tell compelling stories that resonate with
              stakeholders and investors.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Pattern Recognition:</strong> You've developed the analytical eye to
              spot temporal patterns, seasonal variations, and demand fluctuations. You can
              now identify which variables matter most and generate hypotheses for predictive
              modeling.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Business Communication:</strong> You've learned to translate technical
              findings into business insights. Your exploration work now bridges the gap
              between data and decisions, making you a more effective consultant.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>Real-World Impact</h2>

        <p>
          The insights you've uncovered for your bike-sharing client go beyond academic
          exercises. You've identified peak demand periods that inform fleet sizing decisions,
          discovered weather patterns that affect usage, and revealed seasonal variations that
          guide strategic planning. Your visualizations tell stories that investors understand
          and business leaders can act upon.
        </p>

        <p>
          This exploration work creates the foundation for everything that follows. The
          patterns you've discovered will guide your feature selection in modeling. The
          relationships you've identified will inform your algorithm choices. The insights
          you've generated will help interpret your model results.
        </p>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <p>
            <strong>Key Insight:</strong> Data exploration isn't just a preliminary step—it's
            the strategic intelligence that makes everything else more effective. The time you
            invest in understanding your data pays dividends throughout the entire project.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h2>What's Next: Model Training</h2>

        <p>
          Your startup client is impressed with your insights and visualizations. The investor
          presentation was a success! Now they want to take the next step: building sophisticated
          demand prediction models that can compete with established players. You'll use the
          patterns you've discovered to train machine learning models that predict bike demand
          with professional-grade accuracy.
        </p>

        <h2>Before You Continue</h2>

        <p>
          Before moving to the next module, ensure you're comfortable with the core concepts
          you've learned:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Can you calculate and interpret descriptive statistics for your data?</li>
          <li>Do you understand correlation and how to identify relationships between variables?</li>
          <li>Can you create effective visualizations that communicate insights clearly?</li>
          <li>Are you confident in your ability to identify patterns and generate hypotheses?</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          If any of these areas feel unclear, consider reviewing the relevant lectures. Strong
          exploration skills will make your modeling work more focused, efficient, and successful.
        </p>

        <div class="success-box">
          <p>
            <strong>Congratulations again!</strong> You've mastered the art of data exploration.
            Ready to build predictive models based on your discoveries? Let's train together.
