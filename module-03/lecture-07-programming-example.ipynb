    "Welcome back, junior data consultant! Your Capital Bikes Washington D.C. client now possesses statistical insights - but numbers alone don't drive decisions. Today, you'll transform from statistical analyst to visual storyteller, mastering the visualization techniques that convert complex transportation patterns into compelling, stakeholder-ready analytical narratives.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of data visualization as the consulting translator between mathematical analysis and executive action. While statistical tests quantify relationships, visualizations make those relationships instantly comprehensible to non-technical stakeholders. You'll master the fundamental chart types that professional consultants deploy in their daily work: line plots for temporal patterns, bar charts for categorical comparisons, box plots for distribution analysis, histograms for frequency understanding, and scatter plots for relationship exploration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your client is counting on you to transform your statistical discoveries into visual evidence that justifies million-dollar operational decisions. Every visualization you create serves a consulting purpose: answering specific business questions with clarity and precision that enables confident strategic action.\n",

Use a list comprehension with filtering: `[df[df['season'] == i]['count'] for i in [1, 2, 3, 4]]`. This creates four separate arrays of bike counts. Then pass this list to `plt.boxplot()` along with readable season labels.
