        <h2>Welcome to Model Evaluation</h2>

        <p>
          Welcome to this module, the final technical phase of your consulting journey.
          Your trained models show promise, but your startup client needs rigorous evaluation
          and risk assessment before production deployment. This is where you prove your
          models are truly ready for business use—measuring their accuracy, understanding
          their limitations, and translating technical performance into business value.
        </p>

        <h2>What You'll Learn</h2>

        <p>
          Model evaluation is where technical work meets business accountability. Anyone can
          train a model, but professional data scientists know how to rigorously assess whether
          that model will perform reliably in production. This is the quality assurance phase
          that separates experimental prototypes from production-ready systems.
        </p>

        <p>In this module, you'll master a critical skill:</p>

        <div class="objective-list">
          <h3>Module Learning Objectives</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Performance Metrics & Validation:</strong> Learn to apply appropriate
              evaluation metrics for regression problems, understanding what measures like
              MAE, RMSE, and R² reveal about your models. Master validation techniques that
              ensure performance estimates are reliable and representative of real-world
              conditions. Translate technical metrics into business language that stakeholders
              understand and trust.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>Why Model Evaluation Matters</h2>

        <p>
          Imagine a doctor prescribing treatment without checking if it actually works, or
          an engineer building a bridge without testing if it can bear weight. That would be
          irresponsible and dangerous. The same principle applies to machine learning. Before
          deploying models that drive business decisions, you need rigorous proof they'll
          perform as expected.
        </p>

        <p>
          For your bike-sharing client, inadequate evaluation could mean deploying models
          that fail under certain conditions—perhaps they work well in summer but poorly in
          winter, or they're accurate for weekdays but unreliable on holidays. Poor predictions
          lead to operational failures: stations without enough bikes, wasted rebalancing
          efforts, and disappointed customers. Rigorous evaluation prevents these failures.
        </p>

        <p>
          Through this module, you'll learn to measure model performance using industry-standard
          metrics, validate results to ensure they're reliable, and communicate findings in ways
          that build stakeholder confidence. You'll understand not just how well your models
          perform, but also their limitations, appropriate use cases, and business impact.
        </p>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <p>
            <strong>Remember:</strong> Evaluation isn't just about calculating numbers—it's
            about building trust. Your evaluation report must convince stakeholders that these
            models are ready for production, with clear documentation of their capabilities
            and limitations. Professional evaluation creates the confidence needed for
            deployment decisions.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h2>Ready to Evaluate?</h2>

        <p>
          Your client is waiting for comprehensive evaluation results that will inform their
          deployment decision. The trained models are ready for assessment. Your evaluation
          skills will determine whether these models move from development to production.
        </p>

        <p>
          Let's prove your models are production-ready.
