        <h2>Welcome to Your Data Preparation Journey</h2>

        <p>
          Welcome to this module, where your journey as a data consultant begins in earnest.
          Think of this module as your professional apprenticeship—you're stepping into
          the role of a junior consultant who has been hired by a growing bike-sharing startup.
          Your first assignment? Prepare their raw operational data for sophisticated machine
          learning analysis.
        </p>

        <h2>What You'll Learn</h2>

        <p>
          Data preparation is the foundation of every successful machine learning project.
          Industry experts estimate that data scientists spend 60-80% of their time on data
          preparation—and for good reason. The quality of your data directly determines the
          quality of your insights and predictions.
        </p>

        <p>In this module, you'll master three essential skills:</p>

        <div class="objective-list">
          <h3>Module Learning Objectives</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Pandas Fundamentals:</strong> Learn to work with DataFrames and Series,
              the core data structures that power Python data analysis. You'll understand how
              to load, inspect, and manipulate data efficiently.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Data Quality & Cleaning:</strong> Discover how to identify and address
              data quality issues that plague real-world datasets—missing values, outliers,
              inconsistencies, and errors that could compromise your analysis.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Feature Engineering for Time Series:</strong> Transform raw temporal
              data into powerful predictive features. Extract meaningful patterns from dates
              and times that will become the foundation for accurate demand forecasting.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>Why Data Preparation Matters</h2>

        <p>
          Imagine building a house on a shaky foundation—no matter how beautiful the
          architecture, the structure won't be stable. The same principle applies to
          machine learning. Your client's bike-sharing system generates thousands of data
          points daily: rentals, weather conditions, timestamps, user types. But this raw
          data contains noise, inconsistencies, and hidden patterns that need to be revealed.
        </p>

        <p>
          Through this module, you'll learn to transform messy, real-world operational data
          into a clean, analysis-ready dataset that can reliably drive business decisions.
          You'll work with the Washington D.C. bike-sharing dataset throughout—building
          familiarity and expertise with data that mirrors the challenges your client faces.
        </p>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <p>
            <strong>Remember:</strong> Mastering data preparation isn't just about technical
            skills—it's about developing the professional mindset to ensure data quality,
            communicate findings clearly, and deliver reliable insights your clients can trust.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h2>Ready to Begin?</h2>

        <p>
          Your client is counting on you to prepare their data for analysis. The skills you
          develop in this module will form the foundation for everything that follows—data
          exploration, model training, and performance evaluation.
        </p>

        <p>
          Let's start your journey as a data preparation expert.
