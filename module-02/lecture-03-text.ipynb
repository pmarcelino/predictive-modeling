    "\n",
    "Welcome to your first day as a junior data consultant! Your client, a growing bike-sharing startup, has asked you to help them understand their data and build better demand forecasting capabilities. Like any professional consultant, you need to start with the fundamentals - understanding your tools and your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of this like learning to be a craftsperson. Before a carpenter builds a house, they master their tools: saws, hammers, measuring devices. Before a chef creates a restaurant menu, they understand ingredients, cooking techniques, and basic preparations. As a data consultant, your primary tools are programming languages and libraries - and pandas is the most essential tool for data work in Python.\n",

    "Today, you'll learn pandas not as an abstract programming concept, but as the foundation that will enable you to help your client make better business decisions. Every technique you master here will directly contribute to solving real transportation challenges."

It provides the tools you need to load, clean, analyze, and manipulate data efficiently.\n",

    "- Identify patterns that will inform demand predictions\n",
