Your client, a growing bike-sharing startup, has asked you to help them understand their data and build better demand forecasting capabilities. Like any professional consultant, you need to start with the fundamentals - understanding your tools and your data.\n",

Before a chef creates a restaurant menu, they understand ingredients, cooking techniques, and basic preparations. As a data consultant, your primary tools are programming languages and libraries - and pandas is the most essential tool for data work in Python.\n",
