The output validates our data integrity: bike counts range from 1 to 977 bikes/hour - all positive values within realistic operational limits for a bike-sharing system. Temperature readings span 0.82°C to 41.0°C, representing plausible seasonal variation from near-freezing winter conditions to hot summer days. These ranges confirm no negative bike counts or impossible weather values that would indicate sensor malfunctions, data corruption, or recording errors that must be addressed before analysis."

The output shows bike usage averages 191.6 bikes/hour with a median of 145, indicating right-skewed demand where peak periods significantly exceed typical usage. The standard deviation of 181.1 bikes/hour reveals high variability - nearly equal to the mean - suggesting substantial fluctuations between low demand (25th percentile: 42 bikes) and peak periods (75th percentile: 284 bikes). This 6.8x difference between quartiles indicates the system needs significant capacity buffer, with maximum demand reaching 977 bikes/hour - over 5x the average and 6.7x the median."
