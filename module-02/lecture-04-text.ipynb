    "## 1. The Reality of Real-World Transportation Data\n",
    "\n",
    "As your consulting work progresses, you'll quickly discover a fundamental truth: **real-world data is messy**. The clean datasets you see in textbooks don't exist in professional practice. Your bike-sharing client's data comes from sensors that malfunction, weather stations that go offline, and databases that occasionally corrupt records.\n",
    "\n",
    "This messiness isn't just a technical inconvenience - it's a business-critical challenge. **Poor data quality can lead to incorrect demand predictions**, resulting in empty bike stations when customers need them or overflow situations where returning bikes becomes impossible. These operational failures directly impact customer satisfaction and revenue.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your role as a professional consultant is to **transform messy, incomplete data into reliable foundations for business decision-making**. This requires systematic approaches, clear documentation, and transparent communication about data limitations and cleaning procedures.\n",
    "\n",
    "After building fluency with pandas data structures, indexing, grouping, and datetime handling in Lecture 3, we now put those skills to work. In this lecture, we use them to run a fast, defensible data quality triage before modeling — the same practical checks you’ll rely on in professional projects."

    "### 2.1. Understanding Data Quality Dimensions\n",
    "\n",
    "Data quality exists along multiple dimensions, each of which can influence your analysis in different ways. Let’s break down the five most important ones and see how they appear in transportation data:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Completeness**\n",
    "   - *Definition:* Whether all expected values are present in the dataset.\n",
    "   - *Why it matters:* Missing values create blind spots, especially when the missingness is not random.\n",
    "   - *Example:* If bike-sharing sensors fail during storms, you may lose exactly the data needed to understand weather impacts on demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Accuracy**\n",
    "   - *Definition:* The extent to which recorded values reflect reality.\n",
    "   - *Why it matters:* Inaccurate values can mislead both descriptive analysis and predictive models.\n",
    "   - *Example:* A temperature of -50°C recorded in Washington D.C. in July is a clear sensor error that could confuse demand models.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Consistency**\n",
    "   - *Definition:* Whether data follows uniform formats, units, and scales.\n",
    "   - *Why it matters:* Inconsistent formats can corrupt calculations and comparisons.\n",
    "   - *Example:* Mixing Celsius and Fahrenheit in the same column, or having timestamps in multiple formats, leads to corrupted analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Validity**\n",
    "   - *Definition:* Whether values fall within logical or physically possible ranges.\n",
    "   - *Why it matters:* Invalid data points indicate measurement or collection errors.\n",
    "   - *Example:* Negative bike counts or humidity above 100% are impossible values that reveal collection problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Uniqueness**\n",
    "   - *Definition:* Whether each observation is recorded only once.\n",
    "   - *Why it matters:* Duplicate records inflate usage counts and distort demand predictions.\n",
    "   - *Example:* If the same rental transaction is logged twice, it looks like demand is higher than it really was.\n",
    "\n",
    "Together, these five dimensions reveal how data quality problems can undermine predictions in different ways. Recognizing these distinct aspects helps you target specific problems rather than applying generic \"data cleaning\" approaches."

    "### 2.2. Missing Data Patterns and Business Implications\n",
    "\n",
    "Not all missing data is created equal. In transportation systems, gaps in the dataset often occur under very specific conditions—the very conditions you want to analyze. Understanding when and why data goes missing helps you choose the right handling strategies and communicate risks to clients.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Weather-Driven Data Loss**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The most common pattern involves sensor failures during extreme weather events. Storms, heavy rain, and temperature extremes can knock out monitoring equipment precisely when weather has the strongest influence on bike usage. This creates a double problem: you lose data exactly when you need it most, and standard statistical assumptions about \"random\" missingness don't apply.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Operational and Maintenance Gaps**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Planned maintenance creates predictable but significant gaps in transportation data. These periods often overlap with major infrastructure changes—like opening new stations or updating software systems—meaning that ignoring the operational context could hide important business insights about system growth and performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Network Effects and Cascade Failures**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Transportation systems are interconnected. When a high-demand station goes offline, neighboring stations typically experience unusual demand spikes. Without data from the offline station, it becomes difficult to distinguish between genuine demand growth and temporary displacement of riders to nearby locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Peak Period Vulnerabilities**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Finally, data failures during rush hours pose special challenges because peak-period predictions drive critical business decisions. Missing data during these high-stakes periods requires more sophisticated handling strategies than gaps occurring during quiet off-peak hours when the business impact is minimal.\n",
    "\n",
    "These four patterns demonstrate why missing data analysis goes beyond simple counts and percentages. Each pattern creates specific risks for demand forecasting and requires tailored handling strategies. By understanding when and why data disappears, you can make informed decisions about imputation, communicate limitations clearly to clients, and avoid building models on unreliable foundations."

    "* The **weather-related variables** such as `temp`, `humidity`, and `windspeed` also contain gaps. Because these are some of the most important explanatory variables in our forecasting model, missingness here reduces our ability to explain variation in bike rentals.\n",
    "* Most critically, the **`count` column — our target variable — is missing in several rows**. This is a red flag: every missing entry in `count` means lost training data, and the reliability of our model hinges on how much usable demand history we have.\n",
    "\n",
    "This single, simple scan already tells us that the dataset cannot be used “as is” for modeling. More importantly, it shows why **structural checks are powerful**: with just one command, we’ve uncovered problems in both our explanatory variables and our target.\n",

    "- $\\sigma$ = the standard deviation (how spread out the data is)\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of the average bike rentals per day like the “center of gravity” of the data. Most days will be close to that average. The Z-score is like a distance meter: it tells us how far a particular day is from the typical pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A Z-score of **0** → exactly average.\n",
    "- A Z-score of **+2** → two steps above average (busier than normal).\n",
    "- A Z-score of **–3** → three steps below average (quieter than normal).\n",
    "\n",
    "When a Z-score is bigger than 3 or smaller than –3, the value is far enough from the average that we should pause and ask: *Is this a real event, or is it an error?*\n",

    "- **Standardize values** so we can compare across variables.\n",
    "- **Give a simple rule of thumb**: beyond 3 = unusual.\n",
    "- **Provide a quick first filter** before applying more advanced techniques.\n",

    "Let’s see how this works in practice using the Washington D.C. bike-sharing dataset. We’ll calculate the Z-scores for daily demand (`count`) and flag potential outliers."

In practice, such findings should be validated with weather data or event calendars.

    "### 4.2. Standardizing the Timeline\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous chapters, we discovered that our timeline is not fully reliable: some hours are missing, while others are duplicated. To move forward confidently, we need to standardize the timeline so that every hour has exactly one valid record.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will do so by:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Collapsing duplicate rows\n",
    "2. Reindexing to a continuous hourly timeline\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Collapsing Duplicate Rows**\n",
    "\n",
    "The bike-sharing system should record **exactly one entry per hour**. If we find multiple rows for the same timestamp, something has gone wrong. These duplicates can arise for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data collection partitioning**: Different sensors or stations reporting separately for the same hour\n",
    "- **System processing delays**: Multiple data collection cycles within the same hour  \n",
    "- **Data pipeline issues**: ETL processes creating duplicate records\n",
    "\n",
    "In all of these situations, the extra rows are not separate time periods but **fragments of the same underlying hour**. This is why we adopt the working assumption that duplicates represent **partial data for a single hour**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of discarding these rows, we will **combine them into one consolidated record**. This approach is practical for our project, but remember that in real consulting work you should always **validate the duplication patterns before applying aggregation**, to confirm that duplicates really are fragments and not a sign of a different data issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we assume that duplicates are **partial fragments of the same hour**, we can combine them into a single record using the following aggregation policy:\n",
    "\n",
    "- For **targets** (`count`, `casual`, `registered`): use the **SUM**, because bike rentals accumulate across fragments. Two partial records for the same hour simply add up to the true total demand.\n",
    "- For **numeric predictors** (e.g., weather variables): take the **MEAN**, since these are measured as continuous conditions. Averaging across fragments best represents the overall hourly state.\n",
    "- For **categorical variables** (`holiday`, `weather`, `season`): take the **FIRST** value, because these codes should remain stable within an hour. A duplicated categorical code does not add new information."
