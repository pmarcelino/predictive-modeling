    "\n",
    "As your consulting work progresses, you'll quickly discover a fundamental truth: **real-world data is messy**. The clean datasets you see in textbooks don't exist in professional practice. Your bike-sharing client's data comes from sensors that malfunction, weather stations that go offline, and databases that occasionally corrupt records.\n",
    "\n",
    "This messiness isn't just a technical inconvenience - it's a business-critical challenge. Poor data quality can lead to incorrect demand predictions, resulting in empty bike stations when customers need them or overflow situations where returning bikes becomes impossible. These operational failures directly impact customer satisfaction and revenue.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your role as a professional consultant is to transform messy, incomplete data into reliable foundations for business decision-making. This requires systematic approaches, clear documentation, and transparent communication about data limitations and cleaning procedures."

    "### 2.1. Understanding Data Quality Dimensions\n",
    "\n",
    "Data quality is not simply “good” or “bad.” Instead, it exists along multiple dimensions, each of which can influence your analysis in different ways. Let’s break down the five most important ones and see how they appear in transportation data:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Completeness**\n",
    "   *Definition:* Whether all expected values are present in the dataset.\n",
    "   *Why it matters:* Missing values create blind spots, especially when the missingness is not random.\n",
    "   *Example:* If bike-sharing sensors fail during storms, you may lose exactly the data needed to understand weather impacts on demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Accuracy**\n",
    "   *Definition:* The extent to which recorded values reflect reality.\n",
    "   *Why it matters:* Inaccurate values can mislead both descriptive analysis and predictive models.\n",
    "   *Example:* A temperature of -50°C recorded in Washington D.C. in July is a clear sensor error that could confuse demand models.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Consistency**\n",
    "   *Definition:* Whether data follows uniform formats, units, and scales.\n",
    "   *Why it matters:* Inconsistent formats can corrupt calculations and comparisons.\n",
    "   *Example:* Mixing Celsius and Fahrenheit in the same column, or having timestamps in multiple formats, leads to corrupted analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Validity**\n",
    "   *Definition:* Whether values fall within logical or physically possible ranges.\n",
    "   *Why it matters:* Invalid data points indicate measurement or collection errors.\n",
    "   *Example:* Negative bike counts or humidity above 100% are impossible values that reveal collection problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Uniqueness**\n",
    "   *Definition:* Whether each observation is recorded only once.\n",
    "   *Why it matters:* Duplicate records inflate usage counts and distort demand predictions.\n",
    "   *Example:* If the same rental transaction is logged twice, it looks like demand is higher than it really was.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Understanding the Five-Dimensional Framework**\n",
    "\n",
    "Together, these five dimensions reveal how data quality problems can undermine predictions in different ways. Completeness affects the scope of your analysis, accuracy determines whether your insights reflect reality, consistency ensures reliable calculations, validity catches measurement errors, and uniqueness prevents false inflation of patterns. Recognizing these distinct aspects helps you target specific problems rather than applying generic \"data cleaning\" approaches."

    "### 2.2. Missing Data Patterns and Business Implications\n",
    "\n",
    "Not all missing data is created equal. In transportation systems, gaps in the dataset often occur under very specific conditions—the very conditions you want to analyze. Understanding when and why data goes missing helps you choose the right handling strategies and communicate risks to clients.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Weather-Driven Data Loss**\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common pattern involves sensor failures during extreme weather events. Storms, heavy rain, and temperature extremes can knock out monitoring equipment precisely when weather has the strongest influence on bike usage. This creates a double problem: you lose data exactly when you need it most, and standard statistical assumptions about \"random\" missingness don't apply.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Operational and Maintenance Gaps**\n",
    "\n",
    "Planned maintenance creates predictable but significant gaps in transportation data. These periods often overlap with major infrastructure changes—like opening new stations or updating software systems—meaning that ignoring the operational context could hide important business insights about system growth and performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Network Effects and Cascade Failures**\n",
    "\n",
    "Transportation systems are interconnected. When a high-demand station goes offline, neighboring stations typically experience unusual demand spikes. Without data from the offline station, it becomes difficult to distinguish between genuine demand growth and temporary displacement of riders to nearby locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Peak Period Vulnerabilities**\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, data failures during rush hours pose special challenges because peak-period predictions drive critical business decisions. Missing data during these high-stakes periods requires more sophisticated handling strategies than gaps occurring during quiet off-peak hours when the business impact is minimal.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Business Impact of Missing Data Patterns**\n",
    "\n",
    "These four patterns demonstrate why missing data analysis goes beyond simple counts and percentages. Each pattern creates specific risks for demand forecasting and requires tailored handling strategies. By understanding when and why data disappears, you can make informed decisions about imputation, communicate limitations clearly to clients, and avoid building models on unreliable foundations."

    "### 2.3. Systematic Inconsistencies\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we've examined missing data, let's shift to inconsistencies that are harder to detect. Beyond obvious errors like negative values, transportation datasets often contain **systematic inconsistencies** that masquerade as genuine patterns. These subtle problems are particularly dangerous because they can mislead analysis while appearing completely normal. As a consultant, actively searching for these hidden inconsistencies protects both your models and your credibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common systematic inconsistencies in transportation data fall into four categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Temporal Zone Confusion**\n",
    "  Mixing standard time and daylight saving time can create sudden “demand anomalies” around clock changes that have nothing to do with rider behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Geographic Coordinate Systems**\n",
    "  If different coordinate systems are used to record station locations, spatial analysis may reveal patterns that are purely artifacts of mismatched formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Operational Status Mixing**\n",
    "  True zero demand (no rides) is very different from a station being unavailable due to maintenance or full capacity. Mixing these cases together creates artificial demand patterns that models mistakenly learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Unit Inconsistencies**\n",
    "  Data collected in multiple units—such as Fahrenheit vs. Celsius, or miles vs. kilometers—corrupts correlations and model training if not standardized."

    "\n",
    "As a consultant, clients will expect you to follow a systematic, defensible process for data quality assessment — not ad-hoc checking. The 4-step process we'll use gives you a professional framework that you can explain and justify to any client:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Quick Data Quality Checks** – your first diagnostic scan to flag obvious issues.\n",
    "2. **Time Series Integrity Check** – systematic analysis of temporal continuity.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Definition:** Quick data quality checks are rapid diagnostic scans that assess whether a dataset is fundamentally sound before investing time in detailed analysis or modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** Think of this like a consultant's \"triage\" — in just a few minutes, you want to know whether the dataset looks broadly reliable, where the biggest risks lie, and which areas deserve closer investigation. When you receive a new dataset from a client, this scan is your first step, not modeling.\n",

This step sounds simple, but it’s one of the fastest ways to detect import errors, unexpected row counts, or inconsistencies in data types — all of which can indicate bigger problems lurking beneath the surface."

    "* The **weather-related variables** such as `temp`, `humidity`, and `windspeed` also contain gaps. Because these are some of the most important explanatory variables in our forecasting model, missingness here reduces our ability to explain variation in bike rentals.\n",
    "* Most critically, the **`count` column — our target variable — is missing in several rows**. This is a red flag: every missing entry in `count` means lost training data, and the reliability of our model hinges on how much usable demand history we have.\n",
    "\n",
    "This single, simple scan already tells us that the dataset cannot be used “as is” for modeling. More importantly, it shows why **structural checks are powerful**: with just one command, we’ve uncovered problems in both our explanatory variables and our target.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is exactly the kind of insight to highlight at the project start: *\"Before we can move into forecasting, we've already identified major gaps in the dataset that could affect both explanatory power and prediction accuracy.\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Value Sanity Checks**\n",
    "\n",
    "After confirming the dataset’s structure, the next step is to ask: *“Do the values themselves make sense?”*\n",
    "\n",
    "Every variable has **natural boundaries** defined by either business rules or physical limits:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Bike rentals cannot be negative.\n",
    "* Humidity must fall between 0% and 100%.\n",
    "* Local temperatures should stay within climate-appropriate ranges.\n",

    "**Definition:** Outlier detection identifies data points that deviate significantly from the expected pattern — values that are unusually high, unusually low, or inconsistent with the rest of the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** In transportation data, outliers can represent legitimate extreme events (like snowstorms causing demand drops), data collection errors (like negative bike rentals), or operational anomalies (like maintenance affecting normal patterns). Each type requires different treatment strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:** The goal is not just to detect outliers, but to classify them correctly so that legitimate events are preserved while errors are corrected. This ensures models learn from real patterns rather than data quality issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "Outliers matter in urban mobility because they can carry very different meanings:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Legitimate Extreme Events**: Real extraordinary conditions like snowstorms or city-wide festivals that models should account for\n",
    "- **Data Collection Errors**: Sensor malfunctions or impossible values that need correction or removal\n",
    "- **Operational Anomalies**: Maintenance activities or system changes that create artificial patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we understand what outliers are, let’s look at the different ways to detect them. Outlier detection methods generally fall into three categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Statistical Methods**: Mathematical rules based on the distribution of the data.\n",
    "2. **Business Logic Methods**: Checks based on domain knowledge and system constraints.\n",
    "3. **Temporal Methods**: Techniques that consider the time-based nature of transportation data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Statistical Methods**\n",
    "\n",
    "Statistical methods use mathematical formulas to identify unusual values. They don’t require prior knowledge of the transportation system - they just look at how far a data point is from what is “normal” in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several statistical approaches, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Z-Score Analysis**\n",
    "- **Interquartile Range (IQR) Method**\n",
    "- **Modified Z-Score**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lecture, we will focus on just one example: **Z-Score Analysis**. A **Z-score** tells us how many “standard steps” (standard deviations) a data point is away from the average.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Z = \\frac{x - \\mu}{\\sigma}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $x$ = the value we’re checking\n",
    "- $\\mu$ = the mean (average) of the data\n",
    "- $\\sigma$ = the standard deviation (how spread out the data is)\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of the average bike rentals per day like the “center of gravity” of the data. Most days will be close to that average. The Z-score is like a distance meter: it tells us how far a particular day is from the typical pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A Z-score of **0** → exactly average.\n",
    "- A Z-score of **+2** → two steps above average (busier than normal).\n",
    "- A Z-score of **–3** → three steps below average (quieter than normal).\n",
    "\n",
    "When a Z-score is bigger than 3 or smaller than –3, the value is far enough from the average that we should pause and ask: *Is this a real event, or is it an error?*\n",
    "\n",
    "We use Z-scores because they:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Standardize values** so we can compare across variables.\n",
    "- **Give a simple rule of thumb**: beyond 3 = unusual.\n",
    "- **Provide a quick first filter** before applying more advanced techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s see how this works in practice using the Washington D.C. bike-sharing dataset. We’ll calculate the Z-scores for daily demand (`count`) and flag potential outliers."

    "The detected anomalies highlight days in winter months (January and February) with demand levels much closer to what we’d expect in summer. For example, January 7 shows more than double the average rentals for that month. These could indicate unusually warm days that encouraged cycling, or they might reflect special events. In practice, such findings should be validated with weather data or event calendars. This illustrates how seasonal anomaly detection helps identify values that break expected seasonal patterns, providing valuable clues about real-world influences on demand."

    "\n",
    "**Definition:** Missing data detection is the systematic analysis of gaps in your dataset to understand their patterns, causes, and potential impact on modeling and analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** Unlike outliers which are individual problematic values, missing data represents systematic gaps that can undermine entire analyses. Missingness often follows patterns — clustering in certain periods, affecting groups of variables together, or reflecting underlying system failures like sensor outages.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:** We analyze missing data patterns to design targeted cleaning strategies rather than applying generic fixes. Understanding where, when, and why data goes missing ensures our solutions address root causes and preserve data integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll explore missing data through three systematic analyses:\n",
    "- **Quantitative assessment** — count and percentage of missing values per variable\n",
    "- **Temporal pattern analysis** — check if gaps cluster in specific time periods  \n",
    "- **Cross-variable analysis** — identify which variables go missing together\n",
    "\n",

    "Since we are working with time-series data, we will start by **standardizing the timeline** and fixing its structural problems — this is a critical first step that ensures we have a reliable temporal foundation.\n",
    "\n",
    "From there, we will follow a standard data cleaning workflow that, while always dependent on the specific dataset and business context, can be generalized into a systematic process that learners can apply to their own projects. Once the timeline is reliable, every suspicious value — whether it’s extreme, impossible, or missing — is treated with the same **three-step decision tree**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Is this an event or an error?**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - *Event* → keep, but **flag** (e.g., snowstorm, festival).\n",
    "   - *Error* → continue.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **If error: Can I fix it with a rule?**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Examples: cap humidity to 100, relabel mis-coded weather categories, set negative rentals to `NaN`.\n",
    "   - If yes → **fix and flag**.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **If cannot fix: Should I impute or drop?**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Predictors (features):** impute if valuable, drop if not.\n",
    "   - **Target (`count`):** never impute for modeling → drop missing rows.\n",
    "   - Always **flag** imputations or dropped ranges.\n",

    "Flagging ensures that every change is **visible, auditable, and explainable**. Flags allow you to:\n",
