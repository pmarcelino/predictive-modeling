    "You now have clean, reliable data from your bike-sharing client - but clean data isn't the same as machine learning ready data. Raw data variables often need transformation, combination, and optimization before machine learning algorithms can use them effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Lecture 4, you learned to identify and handle data quality issues - missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. That cleaning work ensures you're starting with reliable, trustworthy data. Now, we move to the next essential step: transforming that clean data into optimized features for machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of this stage like preparing ingredients for a sophisticated recipe. Having fresh, quality ingredients (clean data) is essential, but you still need to chop, season, and combine them in specific ways to create the final dish (predictive model). Feature engineering is this crucial preparation step that transforms your clean data into optimized inputs for machine learning algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "For transportation consulting, this means creating features that capture the complex temporal, spatial, and operational patterns that drive demand. Simple variables like \"temperature\" and \"hour\" become sophisticated features like \"temperature deviation from seasonal average\" and \"rush hour intensity\" that enable more accurate predictions."

    "\n",
    "Transportation systems exhibit complex patterns that require specialized feature engineering approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Temporal Complexity**: Transportation demand follows nested temporal cycles (hourly, daily, weekly, seasonal) that interact in sophisticated ways. Rush hour patterns differ between weekdays and weekends, seasonal effects vary by time of day, and special events create temporary pattern disruptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Environmental Sensitivity**: Weather affects transportation differently depending on trip purpose, time of day, and seasonal context. A 25Â°C day feels warm in January but cool in July, creating different demand responses that simple temperature variables can't capture.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Network Effects**: Transportation systems are networks where demand at one location affects nearby locations through user behavior, capacity constraints, and operational interventions like bike rebalancing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Operational Interdependencies**: User types (casual vs. registered) respond differently to environmental and temporal factors, requiring features that capture these interaction effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Professional feature engineering transforms these complexities into variables that machine learning algorithms can effectively use to predict demand patterns."

    "### Advanced Temporal Feature Engineering Techniques\n",

    "In this section, we will explore advanced methods for creating **time-based features** that improve prediction models in urban mobility. Transportation demand is strongly influenced by **daily cycles, weekly rhythms, and seasonal patterns**, so carefully engineered temporal features often make the difference between a weak model and a powerful one.\n",

    "\n",
    "**1. Cyclical Encoding for Continuous Time**\n",
    "\n",
    "Time is cyclical: after 23:00 comes 00:00, and after December comes January. But if we use raw numeric values (e.g., `hour = 23` vs. `hour = 0`), many models treat these as very far apart. This creates an **artificial break** in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition**: Cyclical encoding maps linear time values (like hours of the day or months of the year) onto a circle using sine and cosine functions. This way, times that are neighbors in reality remain neighbors in the feature space.\n",
    "\n",

    "1. **Extract temporal components**: We first extract hour, day of week, and month from the datetime column to work with integer values.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Apply sine and cosine transformation**: For each temporal component, we use both sine and cosine functions:\n",
    "   - **Sine component**: Captures the position on one axis of the circle\n",
    "   - **Cosine component**: Captures the position on the perpendicular axis\n",
    "   - Together, they uniquely identify any point on the circle\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Scale by the period**: We divide by the total period (24 for hours, 7 for days, 12 for months) to ensure one complete cycle maps to one full circle (2Ï radians).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Mathematical insight**: The formula `2 * Ï * value / period` converts linear time to radians, where:\n",
    "   - Hour 0 and hour 24 both map to the same point: (sin=0, cos=1)\n",
    "   - Hour 6 maps to: (sin=1, cos=0) \n",
    "   - Hour 12 maps to: (sin=0, cos=-1)\n",
    "   - Hour 18 maps to: (sin=-1, cos=0)\n",
    "\n",
    "With this representation, **23:00 and 00:00 map to nearly the same point** on the circle, preserving their closeness. The Euclidean distance between these encoded points accurately reflects their temporal proximity, unlike raw numeric encoding where 23 and 0 appear far apart.\n",
    "\n",
    "This cyclical encoding works well for many model types (linear regression, tree-based models, kNN, neural networks), since it embeds the true temporal geometry directly into the data.

    "\n",
    "1. **Short-term momentum (3-hour windows)**: These features capture immediate trends and volatility in demand. High volatility might indicate special events or system disruptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Daily weather context (24-hour windows)**: Temperature stability indicates whether weather has been consistent, which affects user behavior predictability. A high daily temperature range suggests variable conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Weekly trend analysis (7-day windows)**: The growth rate compares current demand to recent average, revealing whether the system is experiencing increasing or decreasing usage. Temperature trend identifies sustained weather patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Business-specific aggregations**: Rush hour averages help identify commuting pattern changes, while weekend/weekday ratios reveal seasonal shifts in usage patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Robust handling**: The `min_periods` parameter ensures features are calculated even with some missing data, while adding small constants (+ 1) prevents division by zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "In consulting practice, showing a client the \"rolling 7-day average demand\" can highlight whether usage trends are growing, stabilizing, or declining. The temperature stability feature might reveal that unstable weather periods consistently reduce demand by 15-20%, providing actionable insights for capacity planning.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Lag Features for Sequential Patterns**\n",
    "\n",
    "Urban mobility demand is not randomâit shows **strong sequential dependencies**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition**: A lag feature uses the value of a variable from a previous time step as a predictor for the current step.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose**: These features explicitly introduce historical demand patterns into the model, helping it learn recurring cycles.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Demand 1 hour ago (captures immediate momentum)\n",
    "* Demand 24 hours ago (captures same-time-of-day effects)\n",
    "* Demand 7 days ago (captures weekly repetition)\n",
    "* Average demand at this hour over the past month\n",

    "1. **Immediate momentum (1-3 hour lags)**: These features capture short-term demand trends. If demand was high 1-2 hours ago, it might continue to be high, indicating system momentum or sustained favorable conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Daily repetition patterns (24-48 hour lags)**: These features leverage the strong daily cyclical nature of transportation. Demand at 8 AM today often resembles demand at 8 AM yesterday, especially for commuting patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Weekly recurring cycles (7-14 day lags)**: These capture weekly rhythms where Monday 8 AM patterns repeat week after week. This is especially powerful for commuting and routine trip prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Advanced temporal aggregations**: Instead of just using single lag points, we create rolling averages of same-time-of-day demand and trend analysis to capture whether specific time periods are growing or declining in popularity.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Weather lag effects**: Weather influences decisions with some delay - people may check the weather forecast hours before deciding to bike, creating lag effects between weather changes and demand response.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **User-specific lag patterns**: Casual and registered users show different lag behaviors. Casual users are more spontaneous (shorter lags matter), while registered users are more routine-driven (longer lags are predictive).\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Interaction lag features**: These capture complex relationships, like how Friday's weather might affect weekend recreational biking, or how Saturday's high demand might predict Monday's commuter rebound.\n",
    "\n",
    "For bike-sharing systems, lag features help the model learn that **Monday 8 AM demand this week will likely resemble Monday 8 AM last week**, adjusted for seasonal effects. The correlation values show which time horizons are most predictive - typically 24-hour lags have the strongest correlation for commuting patterns, while 7-day lags excel for recreational usage prediction."

    "**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Gaussian Rush Hour Curves**: The formula `np.exp(-((hour - peak)**2) / (2 * std**2))` creates smooth bell curves centered at rush hour times. This is much more realistic than binary on/off indicators, as demand gradually builds and declines around peak times.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Separate Morning and Evening Features**: While combined rush intensity is useful, separate features allow models to learn that morning and evening rush patterns may differ (e.g., morning rush might be more predictable than evening rush).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Additional Time Peaks**: Beyond traditional rush hours, we capture lunch hour patterns and evening entertainment periods, which also drive bike-sharing demand in urban areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Working Day Adjustment**: Rush hours only apply to working days, so we multiply by the workingday indicator to create features that are zero on weekends and holidays.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Time-to-Rush Distance**: This feature helps models anticipate demand changes - hours immediately before rush hour often show building demand patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Rush Hour Context Periods**: Binary indicators for pre-rush and post-rush periods help models understand transitional demand patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note**: The Gaussian function creates smooth transitions where:\n",
    "> - Peak rush hours (8 AM, 5 PM) get intensity = 1.0\n",
    "> - Hours 1.5 standard deviations away get intensity â 0.6\n",
    "> - Hours 3+ standard deviations away get intensity < 0.1\n",
    "\n",
    "For a bike-sharing operator, this feature encodes how strongly each time of day aligns with commuting demand, giving the model a better understanding of **urban mobility rhythms**. The smooth intensity measure is more realistic than binary rush/non-rush categories and allows models to predict gradual demand transitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Workday vs. Weekend Context**\n",
    "\n",
    "Not all hours are equalâ**the same 8 AM can mean very different things** depending on the day of the week.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition**: Workday/weekend features separate time into business-relevant categories based on how people use transportation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose**: They help models distinguish between commuting-driven patterns (weekday mornings and evenings) and leisure-driven usage (weekend afternoons).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples of features**:\n",

    "\n",
    "2. **Time Period Context Mapping**: The same hour (e.g., 8 AM) gets different contextual features depending on day type. 8 AM on weekday = commuting context; 8 AM on weekend = leisure context.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Business vs Leisure Hour Segmentation**: We classify time periods based on typical activity types rather than just day/time, recognizing that leisure can happen on weekday evenings too.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Special Day Transition Effects**: Friday evenings and Monday mornings have unique patterns as people transition between work and leisure modes.\n",

    "5. **Behavioral Probability Indicators**: Instead of binary classifications, we assign probabilities to different activity types, acknowledging that some commuting happens on weekends and some recreation happens on weekdays.\n",

    "**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Solar Position Features**: Days since solstices capture the fundamental solar cycle driving temperature and daylight patterns. This creates smooth, continuous features rather than categorical seasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Within-Season Progression**: Instead of treating \"spring\" as uniform, we track progress from early spring (0.0) to late spring (1.0), capturing gradual changes within each season.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Temperature Trend Analysis**: 7-day temperature trends identify sustained warming or cooling periods, while seasonal deviation shows when current conditions differ from historical norms.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Daylight Calculations**: We approximate actual daylight hours for Washington DC's latitude, capturing the solar influence on bike usage patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Seasonal Transitions**: Distance to seasonal transition points identifies periods of rapid change when user behavior might be most sensitive to conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Advanced Interactions**: Seasonal temperature surprise quantifies how unusual current weather is, while early/late season indicators capture different behavioral patterns within seasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **User Behavior Context**: Growing vs dormant season features reflect the fundamental rhythm of bike-sharing usage throughout the year.\n",
    "\n",
    "A city may see steady growth in bike demand as spring progressesânot just because of \"spring\" as a category, but because days are getting warmer and longer. Encoding progression allows the model to learn these subtler patterns, such as the gradual increase in recreational usage as daylight hours expand or the rapid change in commuting patterns during seasonal transitions."

    "\n",
    "* **Scaling** adjusts the range of feature values so they can be compared on equal footing.\n",
    "* **Normalization** reshapes distributions to fit within defined ranges or scales.\n",
    "* Importantly, these transformations do *not* change the underlying patterns in your dataâthey only adjust the numerical representation.\n",

    "\n",
    "Your Washington D.C. dataset contains features with very different scales:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Temperature**: â10 to 40 Â°C\n",
    "* **Humidity**: 0â100%\n",
    "* **Bike counts**: 1â1000+ rentals/hour\n",
    "* **Hour of day**: 0â23\n",
    "\n",
    "If left unscaled, models naturally give more weight to variables with larger ranges. In this case, bike count values in the hundreds will overshadow temperature in the tensâeven if temperature is more predictive of demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine your client asks for a prediction for next Tuesday at 3 PM. If your features arenât scaled properly, the model might overemphasize past rental counts and underweight the fact that the forecast predicts an unusually cold day. The result? An inflated demand forecast and wasted resources.\n",
