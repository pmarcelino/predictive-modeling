        <h2>Congratulations on Completing Data Preparation!</h2>

        <div class="success-box">
          <p>
            <strong>Well done!</strong> You've successfully completed the foundational module
            of your data consultant journey. You've transformed from someone learning about
            DataFrames to a professional who can confidently prepare real-world transportation
            data for machine learning analysis.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h2>What You've Accomplished</h2>

        <p>
          Take a moment to reflect on the professional skills you've developed. These aren't
          just theoretical concepts—these are the core capabilities that data consultants use
          daily in real projects.
        </p>

        <div class="achievement-list">
          <h3>Your New Professional Toolkit</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Pandas Mastery:</strong> You can now load, inspect, and manipulate data
              using DataFrames and Series—the fundamental tools of Python data analysis. You've
              learned operations that form the foundation of every data project.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Data Quality Expertise:</strong> You've developed the critical eye to
              identify data quality issues and the technical skills to address them. You can
              handle missing values, detect outliers, and ensure data consistency—skills that
              directly impact the reliability of business insights.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Feature Engineering Skills:</strong> You've learned to extract predictive
              power from temporal data, creating features that capture seasonal patterns, trends,
              and time-based behaviors. This transforms raw timestamps into valuable predictive
              information.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Professional Workflow:</strong> Perhaps most importantly, you've learned
              the systematic approach that professionals use: inspect, clean, transform, validate.
              This methodology applies to any dataset you'll encounter in your career.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>Real-World Impact</h2>

        <p>
          The data preparation work you've completed for your bike-sharing client isn't just
          academic—it mirrors the challenges faced by real transportation companies. You've
          worked with authentic data containing real patterns, real inconsistencies, and real
          business implications.
        </p>

        <p>
          Your clean, feature-engineered dataset is now ready to reveal insights about demand
          patterns, seasonal variations, and user behaviors. This prepared data becomes the
          reliable foundation for all subsequent analysis and modeling.
        </p>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <p>
            <strong>Key Insight:</strong> The most successful data scientists aren't
            necessarily those who know the most complex algorithms—they're the ones who
            understand their data deeply and prepare it meticulously. You're now one of them.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h2>What's Next: Data Exploration</h2>

        <p>
          Your bike-sharing client is impressed with your data preparation work. The dataset
          is clean, properly structured, and enriched with time-based features. Now they need
          your help with the next critical phase: understanding what the data reveals through
          compelling insights and visualizations for an upcoming investor presentation.
        </p>

        <h2>Before You Continue</h2>

        <p>
          Before moving to the next module, ensure you're comfortable with the core concepts you've
          learned:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Can you load and inspect a dataset using pandas?</li>
          <li>Do you understand how to handle missing values and outliers?</li>
          <li>Can you create time-based features from date information?</li>
          <li>Are you confident in your ability to clean and validate data?</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          If any of these areas feel unclear, consider reviewing the relevant lectures. Strong
          foundations in data preparation will make the exploration phase much more productive
          and insightful.
        </p>

        <div class="success-box">
          <p>
            <strong>Congratulations again!</strong> You're building real professional
            capabilities. Ready to discover what your data can reveal? Let's explore together.
