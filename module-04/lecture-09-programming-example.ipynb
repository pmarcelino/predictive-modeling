    "## Introduction: Advancing Beyond Linear Constraints with Tree-Based Intelligence\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome back to your Capital City Bikes consulting engagement! Eight months after deploying your linear regression models, the board has approached you with competitive intelligence that demands immediate action. Three rival bike-sharing companies have entered your market with sophisticated ML systems achieving demonstrably better predictions during complex scenarios like weather transitions and seasonal shifts.\n",
    "\n",
    "The CEO's message is direct: \"Our linear models served us well for Series A funding, but competitors are now outperforming us with advanced ensemble methods. The Series B investors expect state-of-the-art predictive capabilities. We need you to implement tree-based models that capture the non-linear patterns and feature interactions our linear approach is missing.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of tree-based modeling as graduating from basic algebra to calculus. While linear regression assumes constant relationships across all conditions, decision trees and random forests discover conditional patterns: \"If temperature is warm AND humidity is low AND it's a weekday, expect high commuter demand. But if temperature is warm AND humidity is high, expect 30% lower demand regardless of day type.\" These conditional rules mirror how experienced operations managers actually think about demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task: engineer sophisticated features that expose non-linear patterns, implement decision trees to understand their interpretable rule-based logic, deploy Random Forest ensembles that achieve production-grade accuracy, analyze feature importance to guide strategic investments, and optimize hyperparameters to maximize competitive advantage. Every technique must demonstrate measurable improvements over your linear baseline to justify the algorithmic complexity to stakeholders.\n",

    "Start with `.groupby(['is_rush_hour', 'workingday'])['count'].agg(['mean', 'count', 'std'])` to see how demand varies across combinations. For the heatmap, use `df.pivot_table(values='count', index='hour', columns='dayofweek', aggfunc='mean')` which creates a matrix showing average demand for each hour-day combination. Set `cmap='YlOrRd'` for a heat-based color scheme that makes patterns visually obvious. For temperature × weather interactions, consider using `sns.boxplot(x='temp_category', y='count', hue='weather_severity', data=df)` to show distributions. Look for segments with 2-3x demand differences - these represent high-value operational optimization opportunities. The heatmap will clearly show morning/evening rush hour peaks on weekdays versus flatter weekend patterns. Business insight: rush hour + working day combinations might show 300+ bikes/hour while night + weekend shows <50 bikes/hour, revealing where fleet positioning matters most.\n",

    "Use `max_depth=3` to create a tree shallow enough to visualize clearly on one page. The `plot_tree()` function requires `feature_names=feature_columns` (the list of column names you defined in Step 1) to display readable feature labels instead of generic \"X[0]\" notation. Set `filled=True` to color nodes by prediction value (darker colors = higher predicted demand) and `rounded=True` for professional appearance. After visualization, use `tree_shallow.feature_importances_` to extract which features appear most frequently in the top splits - these are the key drivers the tree identified. A shallow tree sacrifices accuracy for interpretability, so expect test R² around 65-75% (lower than deeper trees) but you gain the ability to communicate exact decision logic to stakeholders. The visualization will show something like: \"If hour <= 12.5 AND workingday <= 0.5, predict low demand (weekend morning pattern)\". These are the if-then business rules your operations team can actually use for planning.\n",

    "Loop through each ensemble size and create a fresh `RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=n_trees, random_state=42, n_jobs=-1)` for each iteration. Use `time.time()` before and after `.fit()` to measure training duration: `start = time.time(); model.fit(X, y); duration = time.time() - start`. Store all results in a list of dictionaries, then convert to DataFrame for easy analysis and visualization. The performance curve typically shows diminishing returns: 10→50 trees gives large improvement, 100→200 gives small improvement, 200→300 gives minimal improvement. Training time increases linearly with tree count (200 trees takes ~2x as long as 100 trees) so there's a clear tradeoff. Business insight: 100-200 trees usually provides the sweet spot - excellent performance without excessive training time. For production deployment, consider whether faster predictions (fewer trees) or maximum accuracy (more trees) matters more to your client's use case. If they need real-time predictions for millions of users, fewer trees might be preferable; if they're doing daily batch forecasting for operational planning, more trees at higher accuracy makes sense.\n",

    "Import `permutation_importance` from `sklearn.inspection` which implements the shuffling approach. Call it with `permutation_importance(model, X_test, y_test, n_repeats=10, random_state=42, n_jobs=-1)` - note we use X_test (not X_train) because we want to measure how much each feature helps generalization to new data. The function returns an object with `.importances_mean` (average importance across repeats) and `.importances_std` (standard deviation showing consistency). Create a comparison DataFrame joining MDI importance (from `model.feature_importances_`) with permutation importance - use `.sort_values('perm_importance', ascending=False)` to rank by permutation scores. Look for agreement: if both methods rank a feature highly, that's strong evidence it truly matters. Disagreement suggests correlated features (e.g., `temp` and `atemp` are highly correlated, so MDI may split their importance unpredictably). Permutation importance is more reliable but computationally expensive (requires making predictions multiple times), while MDI is fast but can be biased by correlations. Business insight: Features with high importance in BOTH methods are your most reliable strategic priorities.\n",

    "Access grid search results via `pd.DataFrame(grid_search.cv_results_)` which contains all parameter combinations and their scores. Use `.groupby('param_PARAMETER_NAME')['mean_test_score'].agg(['mean', 'std', 'min', 'max'])` to see how each parameter value performs. For visualization, extract unique parameter values and calculate mean scores across all combinations containing each value - this shows the parameter's overall effect. Handle the `None` value in `max_depth` by converting to string for plotting. Calculate parameter importance as `max_score - min_score` across all configurations - large range means the parameter strongly affects performance, small range means it doesn't matter much. Business insight: high-impact parameters (e.g., `max_depth`, `n_estimators`) require careful tuning and justify grid search cost; low-impact parameters (e.g., `min_samples_leaf`) can use default values to simplify the model. If `max_depth` shows minimal impact, the default unlimited depth might be optimal for your data. If `n_estimators` shows strong impact, consider increasing tree count further for production deployment.\n",
