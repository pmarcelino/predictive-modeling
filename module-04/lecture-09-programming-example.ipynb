    "## Introduction: Advancing Beyond Linear Constraints with Tree-Based Intelligence\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome back to your Capital City Bikes consulting engagement! Eight months after deploying your linear regression models, the board has approached you with competitive intelligence that demands immediate action. Three rival bike-sharing companies have entered your market with sophisticated ML systems achieving demonstrably better predictions during complex scenarios like weather transitions and seasonal shifts.\n",
    "\n",
    "The CEO's message is direct: \"Our linear models served us well for Series A funding, but competitors are now outperforming us with advanced ensemble methods. The Series B investors expect state-of-the-art predictive capabilities. We need you to implement tree-based models that capture the non-linear patterns and feature interactions our linear approach is missing.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of tree-based modeling as graduating from basic algebra to calculus. While linear regression assumes constant relationships across all conditions, decision trees and random forests discover conditional patterns: \"If temperature is warm AND humidity is low AND it's a weekday, expect high commuter demand. But if temperature is warm AND humidity is high, expect 30% lower demand regardless of day type.\" These conditional rules mirror how experienced operations managers actually think about demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task: engineer sophisticated features that expose non-linear patterns, implement decision trees to understand their interpretable rule-based logic, deploy Random Forest ensembles that achieve production-grade accuracy, and analyze feature importance to guide strategic investments. Every technique must demonstrate measurable improvements over your linear baseline to justify the algorithmic complexity to stakeholders.\n",

    "Start with `.groupby(['is_rush_hour', 'workingday'])['count'].agg(['mean', 'count', 'std'])` to see how demand varies across combinations. For the heatmap, use `df.pivot_table(values='count', index='hour', columns='dayofweek', aggfunc='mean')` which creates a matrix showing average demand for each hour-day combination. Set `cmap='YlOrRd'` for a heat-based color scheme that makes patterns visually obvious. For temperature × weather interactions, consider using `sns.boxplot(x='temp_category', y='count', hue='weather_severity', data=df)` to show distributions. Look for segments with 2-3x demand differences - these represent high-value operational optimization opportunities. The heatmap will clearly show morning/evening rush hour peaks on weekdays versus flatter weekend patterns. Business insight: rush hour + working day combinations might show 300+ bikes/hour while night + weekend shows <50 bikes/hour, revealing where fleet positioning matters most.\n",

    "Use `max_depth=3` to create a tree shallow enough to visualize clearly on one page. The `plot_tree()` function requires `feature_names=feature_columns` (the list of column names you defined in Step 1) to display readable feature labels instead of generic \"X[0]\" notation. Set `filled=True` to color nodes by prediction value (darker colors = higher predicted demand) and `rounded=True` for professional appearance. After visualization, use `tree_shallow.feature_importances_` to extract which features appear most frequently in the top splits - these are the key drivers the tree identified. A shallow tree sacrifices accuracy for interpretability, so expect test R² around 65-75% (lower than deeper trees) but you gain the ability to communicate exact decision logic to stakeholders. The visualization will show something like: \"If hour <= 12.5 AND workingday <= 0.5, predict low demand (weekend morning pattern)\". These are the if-then business rules your operations team can actually use for planning.\n",

    "Loop through each ensemble size and create a fresh `RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=n_trees, random_state=42, n_jobs=-1)` for each iteration. Use `time.time()` before and after `.fit()` to measure training duration: `start = time.time(); model.fit(X, y); duration = time.time() - start`. Store all results in a list of dictionaries, then convert to DataFrame for easy analysis and visualization. The performance curve typically shows diminishing returns: 10→50 trees gives large improvement, 100→200 gives small improvement, 200→300 gives minimal improvement. Training time increases linearly with tree count (200 trees takes ~2x as long as 100 trees) so there's a clear tradeoff. Business insight: 100-200 trees usually provides the sweet spot - excellent performance without excessive training time. For production deployment, consider whether faster predictions (fewer trees) or maximum accuracy (more trees) matters more to your client's use case. If they need real-time predictions for millions of users, fewer trees might be preferable; if they're doing daily batch forecasting for operational planning, more trees at higher accuracy makes sense.\n",

    "Good experimental features to try: `temp_squared = df['temp'] ** 2` (captures non-linear temperature effects), `is_midday = ((df['hour'] >= 11) & (df['hour'] <= 14)).astype(int)` (lunch hour patterns), `temp_humidity_interaction = df['temp'] * df['humidity']` (discomfort index), `hour_squared = df['hour'] ** 2` (non-linear time effects), or `weekend_weather = df['is_weekend'] * df['weather_severity']` (weekend sensitivity to bad weather). After creating features, ensure they're included in `experimental_features = feature_columns + ['new_feature1', 'new_feature2', ...]`. When analyzing importance, look for: (1) Did any new features break into top 10? (2) Did performance improve meaningfully (>1% R² gain)? (3) Are new features interpretable enough for business use? Sometimes new features improve training accuracy but add complexity without production value. The visualization comparison shows if new features displace old ones or just add marginal value at the bottom of rankings. Business insight: Only keep experimental features that both improve performance AND rank in top 15 - otherwise they add computational cost without strategic benefit.\n",

    "Use the same `tscv = TimeSeriesSplit(n_splits=5)` object for both models to ensure identical fold splits for fair comparison. Call `cross_val_score(model, X, y, cv=tscv, scoring='r2', n_jobs=-1)` for each model - the function returns an array with one score per fold. Calculate standard deviation using `.std()` - lower std means more consistent performance across time periods. Create comparison visualizations using bar charts (fold-by-fold) and box plots (distribution) to show both mean performance and variability differences. The Decision Tree typically shows higher variability (large std dev) because each fold produces a completely different tree structure based on that specific time period's data, while Random Forest averages 100 trees which smooths out temporal variations. Business insight: Lower variability means more predictable production performance - executives prefer models that consistently deliver promised accuracy rather than models that sometimes excel but sometimes fail. If Random Forest shows 30-50% lower standard deviation, that's strong evidence for ensemble reliability worth communicating to stakeholders.\n",
