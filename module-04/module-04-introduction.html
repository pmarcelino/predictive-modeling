        <h2>Welcome to Model Training</h2>

        <p>
          Welcome to this module, where your consulting journey reaches its most exciting
          phase. Your startup client is thrilled with your data preparation and exploration
          work. The investor presentation was a success, and now they're ready for the next
          level: sophisticated demand prediction models that can compete with established
          players. This is where you transform insights into predictions.
        </p>

        <h2>What You'll Learn</h2>

        <p>
          Model training is where machine learning becomes tangible. You'll take the patterns
          you discovered during exploration and build algorithms that can predict future bike
          demand. This is the core of predictive analytics—teaching computers to learn from
          historical data and make accurate forecasts.
        </p>

        <p>In this module, you'll master two powerful approaches:</p>

        <div class="objective-list">
          <h3>Module Learning Objectives</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Linear Models for Prediction:</strong> Learn to implement linear
              regression, the foundational algorithm of predictive analytics. Understand how
              to model relationships between features and target variables, interpret
              coefficients, and leverage the simplicity and interpretability that makes linear
              models valuable for business communication.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Tree-Based Models:</strong> Master decision trees and ensemble methods
              like Random Forest. Discover how these powerful algorithms capture complex,
              non-linear relationships in your data, automatically handle feature interactions,
              and achieve superior predictive performance for sophisticated forecasting.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>Why Model Training Matters</h2>

        <p>
          Imagine having a crystal ball that could predict tomorrow's bike demand based on
          weather forecasts, time of day, and seasonal patterns. That's essentially what
          you're building—not through magic, but through algorithms that learn patterns from
          historical data and apply them to new situations.
        </p>

        <p>
          For your bike-sharing client, accurate demand predictions drive critical business
          decisions: How many bikes should be available at each station? When should
          rebalancing operations occur? What staffing levels are needed? Poor predictions mean
          either disappointed customers (too few bikes) or wasted resources (too many bikes).
          Your models will directly impact operational efficiency and customer satisfaction.
        </p>

        <p>
          Through this module, you'll learn to select appropriate algorithms, train them on
          your prepared data, and optimize their performance. You'll understand the strengths
          and limitations of different approaches, enabling you to make informed modeling
          decisions that balance accuracy, interpretability, and computational requirements.
        </p>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <p>
            <strong>Remember:</strong> Great models aren't just technically sophisticated—
            they solve real business problems. As you train models, always connect technical
            performance back to business impact. A slightly less accurate but much faster
            model might be the right choice for real-time predictions.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h2>Ready to Build?</h2>

        <p>
          Your client is counting on your expertise to build production-ready prediction
          models. The data is prepared, the patterns are understood, and the business
          requirements are clear. Your modeling skills will transform all that preparation
          into actionable forecasts.
        </p>

        <p>
          Let's build models that predict the future.
