        <h2>Congratulations on Completing Model Training!</h2>

        <div class="success-box">
          <p>
            <strong>Well done!</strong> You've successfully built the core capability of
            any machine learning professional—the ability to train predictive models. You've
            transformed from someone who understands data into someone who can teach computers
            to predict the future. This is machine learning in action.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h2>What You've Accomplished</h2>

        <p>
          The modeling skills you've developed in this module represent the heart of
          predictive analytics. You've learned to select algorithms, train them effectively,
          and understand their strengths and limitations.
        </p>

        <div class="achievement-list">
          <h3>Your New Professional Toolkit</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Linear Regression Mastery:</strong> You can now implement and interpret
              linear models, understanding how features relate to predictions. You've learned
              to balance simplicity and performance, creating models that are both effective
              and explainable to business stakeholders.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Ensemble Methods Expertise:</strong> You've mastered decision trees and
              Random Forest algorithms, learning to capture complex patterns and non-linear
              relationships. You understand how ensemble methods combine multiple models to
              achieve superior predictive performance.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Algorithm Selection:</strong> You've developed the judgment to choose
              appropriate algorithms for different scenarios. You can now balance accuracy,
              interpretability, training time, and computational requirements based on
              business needs.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Model Training Workflow:</strong> You've learned the professional
              process of splitting data, training models, and preparing for evaluation. This
              systematic approach ensures reliable, reproducible results that clients can
              trust.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>Real-World Impact</h2>

        <p>
          The models you've built for your bike-sharing client aren't just academic exercises—
          they represent production-ready prediction capabilities. Your linear regression model
          provides interpretable insights about which factors drive demand, while your Random
          Forest model captures complex patterns for accurate forecasting. Together, they give
          your client both understanding and performance.
        </p>

        <p>
          These trained models can now predict bike demand hours or days in advance, enabling
          proactive fleet management, optimized rebalancing operations, and improved customer
          satisfaction. Your work directly translates into operational efficiency and business
          value.
        </p>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <p>
            <strong>Key Insight:</strong> Training models is just one step in the ML workflow.
            The real challenge lies in evaluating their performance, understanding their
            limitations, and ensuring they deliver reliable business value. That's what comes
            next.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h2>What's Next: Model Evaluation</h2>

        <p>
          Your models show promise, but your startup client needs comprehensive evaluation
          and risk assessment before production deployment. How accurate are these predictions?
          Do they perform consistently across different conditions? What are their limitations?
          You'll learn to answer these critical questions with rigorous evaluation techniques
          that ensure your models are truly ready for business use.
        </p>

        <h2>Before You Continue</h2>

        <p>
          Before moving to the next module, ensure you're comfortable with the core concepts
          you've learned:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Can you implement and interpret linear regression models?</li>
          <li>Do you understand decision trees and ensemble methods like Random Forest?</li>
          <li>Can you split data appropriately for training and testing?</li>
          <li>Are you confident in your ability to select algorithms based on business requirements?</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          If any of these areas feel unclear, consider reviewing the relevant lectures. Strong
          modeling foundations will make your evaluation work more insightful and your
          deployment recommendations more confident.
        </p>

        <div class="success-box">
          <p>
            <strong>Congratulations again!</strong> You've mastered the art of model training.
