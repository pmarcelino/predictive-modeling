library**. The *pandas* library has a set of features that allow us to prepare and analyse data.\n","*   **Data structures**. *Pandas* uses two types of data structures, *Series* and *DataFrames*.\n","*   *Data import*. Data can be stored in files, such as CSV files, and it is possible to use *pandas* to import this data.\n","*   **Missing data**. The problem of missing data can be solved by eliminating data or imputing data.\n","*   **Other data preparation operations**. Data selection can be done in several ways, depending on what you want to do. With *pandas* it is also possible to assign, group, sort and remove data.\n","\n","This tutorial introduced several instructions and you are not expected to know them by heart. Above all, this tutorial intends to illustrate the **potential of the *pandas* library** and to serve as a **document for future reference**. Later, with practice, you will begin to retain the instructions that you use most often and the logic behind each instruction becomes more intuitive. "]}]}
